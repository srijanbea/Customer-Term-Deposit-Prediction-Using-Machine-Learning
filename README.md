# Customer-Term-Deposit-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
A machine learning project that predicts whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit using classification models like Decision Tree and SVM. Implemented in Python with data from the UCI Bank Marketing Dataset.

# Customer Term Deposit Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on historical bank marketing campaign data. The implementation is done using a Jupyter Notebook and leverages classification algorithms like Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
